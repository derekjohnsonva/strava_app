# Strava App

The primary goal behind this project is to create a more intuitive user interface
for myself to use to access Strava.

## Building the app

The app is running with svelte-kit.

Install the dependencies with `npm install` (or `pnpm install` or `yarn`)

Start a development server with

```bash
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```

## Deployment

Currently, I am running the app on Vercel.

It is live [here](https://strava-app-nine.vercel.app/)

Go [here](https://vercel.com/derekjohnsonva/strava-app) for the dev console
